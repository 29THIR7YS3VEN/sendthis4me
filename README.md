# Sendthis4me - A web application helping you to find someone to deliver your parcel, built with Javascript, Flask, Jinja, and SQL. Made for the CS50x Final Project
Sendthis4me is a web application to help people quickly and conveniently find someone to deliver your parcel, or to provide an opportunity to make money for those who are willing to deliver them. Secure with an email verification system and an admin dashboard to verify dispatchers, sendthis4me, though still in its development stage, will soon help to improve the logistics situation in Rwanda and other places.
